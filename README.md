⚔️ Exocraft Battle Log – Week 10
This week was all about sharpening my arsenal—understanding core attack vectors and practicing them in a controlled environment. Every step felt like stacking bricks into the foundation of my Exocraft journey.
🛰 Key Takeaways

🔍 Enumeration & Scanning
Learned to map targets using Nmap (open ports, services, versions).
Practiced SSH brute-force to understand login attack surfaces.
Tried vulnerability scanning with Nmap scripts and OWASP ZAP.

🔑 Password Cracking
Explored Ophcrack and rainbow tables to crack Windows password hashes.
Learned how SAM files can be dumped via live USB for offline cracking.

🦠 Malware Arsenal
Studied different types: viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, adware, spyware, rootkits, and keyloggers.
Highlight: tested NJRAT in a VM environment, analyzing features like remote shell, DDoS, ransomware deployment, and even camera/mic hijacking.

🎭 Social Engineering
Revisited phishing: cloned login pages, credential harvesting, and real-world attack methods.

📡 Wi-Fi Hacking (Intro)
Got started with wireless attacks using wifite.
Learned about monitor mode adapters, listing nearby networks, and preparing for handshake captures.

⚔ Reflections
Week 10 gave me a solid grasp of how attackers operate—from brute-force attempts to RAT control panels. More importantly, it reminded me why discipline matters in cybersecurity: understanding these tools is one thing, but practicing safely and ethically is what transforms raw knowledge into true Exocraft power.
Next week? Reverse shells, deeper RAT practicals, and full focus on Wi-Fi hacking. 🚀
